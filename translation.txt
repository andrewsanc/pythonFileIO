Earlier this year, Zuckerberg sent multiple emails to Mike Schmuhl, 
Buttigiegs campaign manager, with names of individuals that he might 
consider hiring, campaign spokesman Chris Meagher confirmed. Priscilla Chan, 
Zuckerbergâ€™s wife, also sent multiple emails to Schmuhl with staff recommendations. 
Ultimately, two of the people recommended were hired.
